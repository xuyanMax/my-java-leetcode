/**
 * 297. Serialize and Deserialize Binary Tree
 * <p>
 * Serialization is the process of converting a data structure or object into
 * a sequence of bits so that it can be stored in a file or memory buffer,
 * or transmitted across a network connection link to be reconstructed later
 * in the same or another computer environment.
 * <p>
 * Design an algorithm to serialize and deserialize a binary graph.tree.
 * There is no restriction on how your serialization/deserialization algorithm should work.
 * You just need to ensure that a binary graph.tree can be serialized to a string and
 * this string can be deserialized to the original graph.tree structure.
 * <p>
 * For example, you may serialize the following graph.tree
 * <p>
 * 1
 * / \
 * 2   3
 * / \
 * 4   5
 * as "[1,2,3,null,null,4,5]", just the same as how LeetCode OJ serializes a binary graph.tree.
 * You do not necessarily need to follow this format, so please be creative and
 * come up with different approaches yourself.
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Note: Do not use class member/global/static variables to store states.
 * Your serialize and deserialize algorithms should be stateless.
