648. Replace Words

    In English, we have a concept called root,
    which can be followed by some other words to form another longer word -
    let's call this word successor. For example, the root an,
    followed by other, which can form another word another.

    Now, given a dictionary consisting of many roots and a sentence. You need to replace all the successor in the sentence with the root forming it. If a successor has many roots can form it, replace it with the root with the shortest length.

    You need to output the sentence after the replacement.

    Example 1:
    Input: dict = ["cat", "bat", "rat"]
    sentence = "the cattle was rattled by the battery"
    Output: "the cat was rat by the bat"
    Note:
    The input will only have lower-case letters.
    1 <= dict words number <= 1000
    1 <= sentence words number <= 1000
    1 <= root length <= 100
    1 <= sentence words length <= 1000
