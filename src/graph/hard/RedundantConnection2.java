/*Example 1:
    Input: [[1,2], [1,3], [2,3]]
    Output: [2,3]
    Explanation: The given DIRECTED graph will be like this:
    1
    / \
    v   v
    2-->3

    Example 2:
    Input: [[1,2], [2,3], [3,4], [4,1], [1,5]]
    Output: [4,1]
    Explanation: The given directed graph will be like this:
    5 <- 1 -> 2
        ^    |
        |    v
        4 <- 3

    Note:
    The size of the input 2D-array will be between 3 and 1000.
    Every integer represented in the 2D-array will be between 1 and N,
    where N is the size of the input array.

public class RedundantConnection2 {
    /*This problem is very similar to “Redundant Connection”.
    But the description on the parent/child relationships is much better clarified.

    There are two cases for the graph.tree structure to be invalid.
            1) A node having two parents;
    including corner case: e.g. [[4,2],[1,5],[5,2],[5,3],[2,4]]
            2) A circle exists
    If we can remove exactly 1 edge to achieve the graph.tree structure,
    a single node can have at most two parents. So my solution works in two steps.

1) Check whether there is a node having two parents.
    If so, store them as candidates A and B, and set the second edge invalid.
2) Perform normal union find.
    If the graph.tree is now valid
        simply return candidate B
    else if candidates not existing
        we find a circle, return current edge;
    else
        remove candidate A instead of B.*/
